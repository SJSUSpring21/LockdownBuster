Project Ideas

Idea #1 Decentralized Vaccine Tracker

Currently, Covid vaccines are a top priority in helping the world get back into normal shape. Using blockchain, we can keep records of who has taken vaccines and who is remaining, this also avoids redudancy.
Also We will also be able to work on the data we get from the application and provide statistics about the whole vaccine program. This data we can further use to make data models.

Idea #2: Use AI to measure and improve Microservice performance

MMicroservices architecture is common ways to deploy containerized software in the cloud. Through this application we will be able to make our system more efficient by
monitoring the performance of the various microservices that are part of this system.
However, increasing number of microservices increases management complexity due to distributed architecture. Network latency and load balancing are other challenges.
and it will be a good learning with respect to the system design.
 
Idea #3: Street vendors support network

Through this application we intend to provide an application to support network of vendors. This will create a local network among small businesses.
Bringing street vendors in an organized group has several advantages:

-	Vendors will get much needed financial help and support to bootstrap their business.

-	Govt will have much desired success in getting them on epayments and cashless economy.

-	this network will be able to uplift them and help them move into high value quadrant. For example, a street food hawker graduates to become a food truck owner. A vegetable seller eventually becomes a “Fresh cut vegies” supplier to apartments. 

-	This network can be connected to micro lenders and other entrepreneurs such as organic farmers.

Idea #2: Use AI to measure and improve Microservice performance
Microservices architecture is common ways to deploy containerized software in the cloud. However, increasing number of microservices increases management complexity due to distributed architecture. Network latency and load balancing are other challenges. See this use case for inspiration.
 
Idea #3: Street vendors support network
Bringing street vendors in an organized group has several advantages:

•	Vendors will get much needed financial help and support to bootstrap their business. 
•	Govt will have much desired success in getting them on epayments and cashless economy.
•	this network will be able to uplift them and help them move into high value quadrant. For example, a street food hawker graduates to become a food truck owner. A vegetable seller eventually becomes a “Fresh cut vegies” supplier to apartments. 
•	This network can be connected to micro lenders and other entrepreneurs such as organic farmers.

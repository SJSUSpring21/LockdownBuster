# Problem statement

The greatest challenge we face in the current crisis is striking the right balance between preventing not only the damage inflicted by Covid-19 but also that which comes from a severe contraction of economic activity.This is a matter of both life and death, and prosperity or poverty, as a deep recession is likely to cause widespread hardship, including increased mortality rates for reasons other than the virus. We must, therefore, find smart strategies for reopening businesses while minimizing health risks.The sectors to be released from lockdown as a matter of priority could be chosen based on the following analysis:
 1. Inability to conduct core business from home:Industries such as accommodation and food services, construction, healthcare, transportation, and warehousing could be the targets of a first wave of lockdown release because they are less suitable for virtual work. Some organizations in these sectors have already been deemed essential and continued operations through the pandemic.
 2. Importance to the national economy:In some countries, manufacturing accounts for a larger percentage of GDP than accommodation and food services (e.g., China or Ireland). In others it is the opposite (e.g., Australia or Norway).
 3.Value added per worker: All else equal, it makes sense to release fewer (less risk of contagion) but more productive (smaller economic loss) people.
 4.Business viability: One must also take into account the viability of certain sectors. For example, retailers are facing severe hardships and the business model makes it harder for state support to compensate.

# Abstract

Our analyses suggest that, assuming that minimum epidemiological standards are met (declining new cases for one week or two weeks, adequate intensive care unit capacity and testing and tracing protocols), the latter approach — sequential opening of sectors starting with those least likely to generate a substantial resurgence of the virus — is the most promising

# Approach
The Blueprint for a Safer Economy relies on two measures – case rate[i] and test positivity[ii] – to determine when a county can move to a less restrictive tier with more sector openings and resultant increased interaction among residents.  In order to avoid a surge of infections, the level of baseline infection in a community should be progressively lower as there is more movement and mixing
